# Blog Project

## Follow along project

This is a follow along project from [this tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) as
a part of [101 Web Development Course - Ruby On Rails Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails?ref=lnav)
from The Odin Project.

It may be used later on as a foundation to create a personal/business blog.

The objective of this project is to get used to rails application as well as REST
model, CRUD and so on. It may, or may not, be updated in the future.
